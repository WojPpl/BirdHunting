## About game

The game is about shooting birds by targeting them with the mouse cursor and shoot them with the left mouse button

Pre level -1 was created after the base game was programmed to simulate near-real physics.

Calculating the position in the pre-level causes the game to not run smoothly, but it makes you realize what the animations should look like in the next levels.

Speed Measurements (ex. driven by gravity) can be chacked in console while playing at this level

Bird animations with the exception of wing animations such as rotating and horizontal movement + falling in non-pre-level levels were obtained using CSS animations (see app.css file)

## Sources

The animations of the bird's wings movement and rain were obtained through the use of animated gifs:
